## Nix
> :warning: **Warning**  
> Highly experimental!!!

This repository uses [Flakes](https://zero-to-nix.com/concepts/flakes/). 
1. [Install](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install/) Nix on your system.
2. Run [`nix develop`](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/nix-develop/) which opens shell with loaded dotnet.
3. If you need MAUI, install workload in the devshell `dotnet workload install maui`.
4. Validate `dotnet --info`, and CookBook build `dotnet build CookBook.sln`. If you make this work (no errors), let [me](pluskal@vut.cz) know and submit PR fixing these instructions!
